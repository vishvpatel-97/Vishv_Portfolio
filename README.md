## **Projects**

## [Project1: Diabetes Prediction using classification algorithms:](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Diabetes_predictor)
- Created a app that predicts the person is having diabetes or not.
- Dataset was taken form the Kaggle.
- **EDA, Data cleaning & Feature engineering techniques** has been applied.
- **Classification Algorithms** like Random Forest , Logistic regression, XGbosst classifier has been applied to the model

## [Project2: Covid-19 detection:](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Covid-19-Detection-Project)
- Complete project on Image classification detecting Covid-19 from X-ray images.
- Dataset of X-ray Images are taken from Kaggle.
- Entire model is trained on total around 325 images.
- For testing I have used around 50 images.
- For details see my github code.

## [Project4: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis:](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
- A complete End-to-End project of NLP, predicting that the Restaurant Review is positive or negative
- Dataset has 10000 rows and 7 columns.
- We have to predict whether a review is "Positive" or "Negative".
- PortStemmer method has been used for Stemming.
- I have also tried WordEmbedding with LSTM.
- I have applied many different algorithms LSTM, Bi-Directional LSTM, RandomForestClassifier, MultinomialNB, SVM and KNN.
