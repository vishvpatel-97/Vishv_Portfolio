## [Project1: Diabetes Prediction using classification algorithms:](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Diabetes_predictor)
- Created a app that predicts the person is having diabetes or not.
- Dataset was taken form the Kaggle.
- **EDA, Data cleaning & Feature engineering techniques** has been applied.
