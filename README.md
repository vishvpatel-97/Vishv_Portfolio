## [Project4: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
- A complete End-to-End project of NLP, predicting that the Restaurant Review is positive or negative
- Dataset has 10000 rows and 7 columns.
- We have to predict whether a review is "Positive" or "Negative".
- PortStemmer method has been used for Stemming.
- I have also tried WordEmbedding with LSTM.
- I have applied many different algorithms LSTM, Bi-Directional LSTM, RandomForestClassifier, MultinomialNB, SVM and KNN.

## [Project5: Hollywood Movie Recommendation engine](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Hollywood-Movie-recommedation-Engine-End-to-End)
- A complete recommendation engine of Hollywood movie built with python & deployed in flask.
- This is a hollywood movie recommender system built with Python. 
- I used IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to built this. Link to dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset
- I have used flask framework in python to build web application.

## [Project6: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/car-price-prediction)
- End-to-end Machine learning(Regression) model to predict the used car price.
- Data was taken from Kaggle.
- First I have done **EDA & Data cleaning** process.
- **Feature engineering & feature selection** techniques has been applied to the model.
- **Used Randomforest regressor** algorithm for the flask framework to build web app.

## [Project7: Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Stacked-LSTM](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Stacked-LSTM)
- A Deep Learning Model (RNN) for Stock Market Prediction.
- I have used the Apple Stock data to predict the future stock price of the company.
- Data was collected from tiingo platform. Tiingo is a financial data platform that makes high quality financial tools available to all.
- Feature Engineering techniques like Min-Max scalar has been applied to the data.
- LSTM algorithm has been applied to the model for predicting the stock price of Apple company for the next 30 days.

## [Project8: Real time Speech-Recognition to search & play youtube video](https://github.com/vishvpatel-97/Speech-Recognition)
- A user can give a voice command in his/her computer's microphone, so that the Speech Recognition API can understand that speech.
- The voice command captured will then trigger a web based query in web browser to open youtube.com search page automatically and search for a particular video based on keyword a user has uttered.
- After that it will select one video from the youtube page automatically thereby playing it in VLC media player available on your computer.
- In a nutshell, not only youtube.com will be opened in a separate web browser automatically but also a video will be search on youtube and played in a media player automatically based on voice command given.
